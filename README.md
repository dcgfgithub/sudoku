# Sudoku
A general sudoku solving app using backtracking and pruning of candidate values. Details of how the algorithm works can be found inside the source code.

The app uses a simple cross-platform open-gl based library (of my own creation) for its user interface. The files supporting this library are all prefixed with `sw_` and most are contained in the `sw/` folder. 

Project files to build the app for iOS are included. There are also supporting files for building an android version of the library, but due to time constraints, project files are not included. I may provide project files at a later date to support the latest version of Android Studio.
